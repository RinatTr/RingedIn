# Plan

## MVP Features
- At the start of the game the computer/secret-keeper will choose a dictionary word
- The guesser loses the game if they guess 6 letters that are not in the secret word
- The guesser wins the game if they guess all letters in the secret word correctly and have
not already lost the game per the conditions above
- The length of the secret word is displayed to the guesser (e.g. as a set of underscores)
- As the guesser makes correct guesses, occurrences of the guessed letter in the word are shown while unknown letters are still hidden
- The number of guesses remaining is displayed
- A list of incorrect guesses are displayed
- retrieve a dictionary list of words from the word dictionary REST API

## Extensions
- 6 colored rings interface indicates wrong guesses left. one colored ring greys out each wrong guess.
- a sound comprised of 6 notes played one by one to indicate wrong guesses left. one note less will be played each time.
- implement filter by difficulty
- implement filter by max or min word length
- implement keyboard event listener (instead of text input)
