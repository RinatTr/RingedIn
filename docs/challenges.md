## Challenges
Make ring width more easily adjustable.
Understand end game logic.
display word at end of game if lost. (add handleEnd in setState of handleSubmit - the result is dependent on the most recent state, hence fired after setState of submit)
Include multiple filters for one new game request: validate that there are words coming back from chosen parameters before new game.

## What would I have changed/improve and how?
Testing userInput (win / lose).
accessibility - visually impaired - text to speech / speech to text, sounds of how many guesses left.
A recursive function to generate ring divs (in case would like to change number of guesses). 


## What did I learn from it?

## What did I de-prioritize ?
